        "\n",
        "Feature-based object tracking involves identifying and tracking objects in a sequence of images or videos using distinctive visual features such as edges, corners, texture patterns, or color histograms. These features act as markers to follow the object's movement across frames.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Importance of Feature Selection:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Distinctiveness: Features must uniquely represent the object to avoid confusion with the background or other objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Robustness: Features should be invariant to changes in lighting, scale, rotation, or partial occlusions.\n",

        "Deep SORT combines motion prediction (using a Kalman filter) and appearance matching (via deep learning) to track multiple objects. Its strengths include handling occlusions through re-identification and scalability in crowded scenes. However, it requires significant computational resources due to deep feature extraction and labeled training data.\n",
