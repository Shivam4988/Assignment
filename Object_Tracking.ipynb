        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Object tracking is the process of locating a moving object (or multiple objects) across consecutive frames in a video sequence. It involves estimating the object's position, trajectory, and sometimes its state (e.g., speed, orientation) over time. Its significance in computer vision lies in enabling applications such as surveillance (e.g., tracking suspicious individuals), autonomous vehicles (e.g., following pedestrians or other cars), human-computer interaction (e.g., gesture recognition), and sports analytics (e.g., ball tracking). By understanding object movements, systems can predict future behavior, detect anomalies, and enhance situational awareness."
