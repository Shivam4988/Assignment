        "GoogleNet, also known as Inception v1, is a 22-layer deep convolutional neural network that introduced the Inception module. Key architectural features include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Parallel convolutions: Each Inception module performs 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 convolutions alongside max pooling, capturing multi-scale features.\n",
